Final project of EDUC8008: The Qualitative Research Methods

**Thread: TBD**

I can imagine people wondering why there’s a repository for a qualitative project. Typically, it’s all about juggling versions like `manuscript-1107.docx`, `manuscript-1107(1).docx`, `manuscript-final.docx`, and finally, `manuscript-final-revised.docx`. But I need a central place to host the documents and slides for my final project, so everyone can access them during my brief 5-minute presentation.

Although most of us agree this course has been, *frankly*, a waste of time, with the instructor failing to deliver any systematic guidance on how to conduct qualitative research, I do think the puzzle I’m exploring for my final project could turn into an interesting story. As always, I might hate it, but I do it—and I do my best.

It’s not that I’m "unwilling to try qualitative methods." Quite the opposite: I’ve read ethnography books as bedtime reading for years. A solid qualitative study builds on a compelling puzzle and an engaging story, grounded in human rationality and academic rigor. I’m not confident this instructor can reveal the craft behind this method. In fact, the way the course has been structured risks misrepresenting qualitative research — making it seem like something “anyone can do” because it doesn’t require “brain-frying math.” ~~I even doubt the instructor’s grasp of the methodology, judging by the loosely organized lectures, vague instructions (I’m not sure their English even reaches CEFR B2), and the quality of the sample interviews shown in class.~~

For me, this course has been a struggle. I hate it, but I’ll do it—and I’ll do my best.
